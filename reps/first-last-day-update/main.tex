		% HAD TO ADD NEWLINE MANUALLY!
		As part of my internship at the \textit{Botanical Institute of Barcelona}, I have been performing an exploratory analysis on (what I refer to as) the \textit{Fringilla insect dataset}. As far as I am concerned, the data and method of acquisition have been \newline first presented in a paper by \textcite{shapoval2012}. The following report is designed to give an update on the progress of analysis as well as highlight some questions (in \cref{sec:questions}) that came up during the work. All project files can be found on \href{https://github.com/gtlab-barcelona/Robert}{github}.
