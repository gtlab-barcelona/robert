# Data Paper

Here, a potential data paper (together with Nazar) could be published, 
introducing the enormous dataset.

It could include an exemplary data analysis, i.e., the first-last-day bit
I did in the very beginning of the internship.

On top,

- a systematic updating procedure for the dataset has to be developed and 
implemented,
- and a consistent data labelling scheme has to be agreed on (e.g., wind
  directions are kind of messy).

Let's see! :)
