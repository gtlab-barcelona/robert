The authors computed the degree of local adaption by comparing the response to global climate anomalies and local ones. Although the local adaption is not of much interest to us, the method of relating population dynamics to climate anomalies is indeed!
Then, the authors proceeded to analyse whether relative sensitivity to local-versus-global climate anomalies was mediated by species' mobility and reproductive rate, turns out it wasn't, but strong "phylogenetic signal" (on degree of local adaption as well as on presence or lack of sensitivity to climatic anomalies);},
