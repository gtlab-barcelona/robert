\section{Open Questions}\label{sec:questions}

To summarize, here is a list of the questions which arose during the exploratory data analysis:

\subsubsection*{Data Exploration}
\begin{itemize}
	\item Does the combination of individual traps introduces any kind of bias to the total count? As \cref{fig:v-atalanta} in \cref{appendix} indicates, some traps were not used throughout the entire period of data acquisition.
	\item The outbreaks of local \textit{I. io} are of interest to us. Were there any attempts you have heard of to find their cause(s)?
	\item The number of missing values decreases drastically after 1997 (see \cref{sec:nans}). Did something fundamentally change in the way the traps were monitored?
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{First Appearance}
\begin{itemize}
	\item According to Fringilla dataset, the temperature is declining in recent years. However, this trend is not supported by CRU TS. Why? Did the method of recording temperature change? 
	Was really the \textbf{maximum} value of daily temperature recorded as stated by \textcite{shapoval2012}?
	\item Is CRU TS an appropriate alternative or do you use any other climate datasets?
	\item What are your thoughts or do you have some general remarks on the analysis of the first appearance? In case you know of any other publication, which might be of interest in this regard, please feel free to share it with us.
\end{itemize}
